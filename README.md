# Homework2--VBA-Challenge
VBA challenge for module 2 of SMU Data Science Course



## Instructions:
This is a fairly rudamentary Sub. Your data has to be orgainized very specifically
1. Make sure all of the following titles are arranged IN THIS ORDER in columns A-G
  "<ticker>	<date>	<open>	<high>	<low>	<close>	<vol>"
2. Date MUST NOT be stored as a string. On Alphabetical Testing, it is stored as a string but on the actual stock data sheet it is not. This relies on a Max function to find the highest date, and will not work with a string. 
3. Data MUST be sorted, first by ticker then by date
